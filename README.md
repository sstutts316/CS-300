# CS-300 (C++)
# Data Structures and algorithms

# 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We had to use data structures and algorithms to design code to correctly read a course data file, create a menu that prompts a user for menu options, load data from the file into a data structure, and sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, print course information.

# 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Reading the problem carefully and brainstorming ideas to reach the expected output. By learning data structures, you will be able to organize, manage, and store data efficiently.  

# 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A great rule of thumb is to always test your code as you write, because it is easier to pin point problem areas before your code gets to extensive. By doing this, you will be able to overcome potential roadblocks.

# 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
We have a better understanding of seeing the end product before we start to code. By using algorithms, we can map out and manipulate your data to behave the way you want and produce a great fully functional program.

# 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Redundant code is your enemy, using functions make your code more readable and will help you to write code that you might be able to reuse on another project. By writing reusable code, you can maintain and adapt your code to fit almost any project.
